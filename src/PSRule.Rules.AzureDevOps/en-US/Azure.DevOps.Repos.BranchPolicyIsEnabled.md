# Ensure the branch policy is enabled

## SYNOPSIS

The repository's default branch should have a branch policy enabled.

## DESCRIPTION

A branch policy is a set of rules that govern the quality of the code and
the team's Git workflow. Branch policies can enforce your team's code quality
and change management standards. They can also help your team find and fix
bugs earlier in the development cycle.

A branch policy can be enabled for the default branch of a repository. This
will help ensure that the code in the default branch is of a high quality and
that the team's Git workflow is followed.

## RECOMMENDATION

Make sure that the branch policy is enabled for the default branch of your
repository. This will help ensure that the code in the default branch is of
a high quality and that the team's Git workflow is followed.
